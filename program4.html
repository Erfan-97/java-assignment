    <h1>Natural environment</h1>
         <p>WThe natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally,<br> meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth. <br> This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.</p>

         <h3>1. Composition</h3>
         <ul TYPE = "CIRCLE">
             <li>Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere[3] as correspondent to rocks, water, air, and life respectively </li>
             <li>Some scientists include as part of the spheres of the Earth, the cryosphere (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere,<br> as well as the pedosphere (corresponding to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere.‚Äù</li>
             <LI>. Earth science (also known as geoscience, the geographical sciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth..</LI>
         </ul>

         <h3>2. Geological activity</h3>
         <OL type="I" start="2">
             <li>The Earth's crust, or lithosphere, is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying mantle.,</li>
             <li>It has been generated greatly by igneous processes in which magma cools and solidifies to form solid rock.</li>
             <LI>Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the decay of radioactive elements.</LI>
         </OL>

         <h3>3. Water on Earth</h3>
         <OL type="1" start="2">
             <li>An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a component of the hydrosphere. <br> Approximately 71% of the surface of the Earth (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean,<br> a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas.</li>

         </OL>

         <h3>4. Human impact on water</h3>
         <Dl type="SQUARE">
             <li>Humans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through dams and stream channelization), urbanization, and deforestation. <br> </dd></li>
             <li>(These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution.)</li>
         </Dl>
         <h3>5. Climate</h3>
         <OL type="1" start="2">
             <li>Climate looks at the statistics of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall,<br> atmospheric particle count and other meteorological elements in a given region over long periods of time.</li>
